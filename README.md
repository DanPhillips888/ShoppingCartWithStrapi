# ShoppingCartWithStrapi

repo to submit cart.jsx for assignment.
To run the restock functionality of the application you will need to run a strapi database 
for the API to be able to retrieve data containing products with correct criteria.

Delete button on items in cart now works as intended.
The checkout total has been adjusted to work with new cart format.

Further implementation being worked on is to remove the hard coded starting products and just use the 
strapi database entries.
